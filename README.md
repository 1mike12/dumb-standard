A hodge podge of standard algorithms and data structures I keep having to write so I've slapped it all together into a standard library. A Dumb one.

> So this is high performance?

No. But it ain't bad

> Why not just install X, Y and Z from npm?

I don't want to be exposed to some left pad shenanigans
